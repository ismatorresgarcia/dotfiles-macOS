# Configuration files for macOS

This is my `.config` directory, stored on GitHub as a backup of my local configuration on macOS. **Please use it with caution**, as improper use can potentially disrupt the configuration of your local machine. The installation process involves cloning the entire repository into your home directory and creating symbolic links to various locations where the programs are supposed to be.

> **_NOTE:_** If requested, I may create an `install.sh` script in the future, which will automate this process by simply executing a command from your terminal while in the home directory.

If you want to dive deeper into using [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) for writing LaTeX documents, I highly recommend visiting the GitHub page of [Benjamin Brast-McKie](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config), where I first discovered the possibility of using NeoVim as a LaTeX editor. His page offers extensive guidance that is essential for getting started. Other important resources I discovered include websites from [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and [Elijan Mastnak](https://github.com/ejmastnak/ejmastnak.com). These resources are particularly helpful for LaTeX in Vim/NeoVim, tailored to users who need to write documents with a strong mathematical focus—ideal for mathematicians, physicists, and engineers.

It’s assumed that you have a basic understanding of LaTeX, Vim, and using a terminal shell to navigate, edit, and install system packages. My current configuration is a blend of what I’ve learned over time, shaped by my personal preferences and needs. To optimize your own setup, I recommend starting with a comprehensive resource that explains how to configure NeoVim. Once you’re comfortable with that, you can explore more advanced materials like those from Gilles Castel and Elijan Mastnak.

To learn the basics of Vim commands and its philosophy, I recommend the [Interactive Vim Tutorial](https://www.openvim.com) website, which I find very helpful.

That said, have fun exploring NeoVim!
